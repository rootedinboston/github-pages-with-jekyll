# Welcome to Rooted in Boston

In Boston, 20-35 year olds make up more than a third of the City's population. Being the most ethnically and racially diverse generation whose rate of civic involvement is steadily increasing, millennials and Gen Z are poised to reimagine civic engagement and ways to meaningfully connect with each other, especially as Boston transitions to a new normal due to the pandemic.

Diversity is core to what makes cities great. Against the backdrop of 2020 with an unprecedented pandemic, use of divisive rhetoric, and national movement against racial injustice, there’s a need now to unite Boston. 

Rooted in Boston is a series of events from April to June that showcases the rich culture and diversity Boston has to offer, with an eye towards justice (a nod to Angela Davis’ thoughts on diversity with justice).

The theme Rooted in Boston can be interpreted two ways:
- Based in, developed from, or influenced by Boston
- Established or grounded, and in Boston

The series’ goal is to bring together communities to promote togetherness in a time of isolation and create and continue conversations for change.

All events will be held virtually via Zoom.
